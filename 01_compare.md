# 01 Compare

The two AP-CSP courses I would like to compare are the code.org CS principles  and the "Beauty and Joy of Computing". Respectively: https://studio.code.org/courses/csp-2022?section_id=4250405 and https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/course/bjc4nyc.html

Both the BJC and Code.org curriculums are very good, prepare students well for the exam, and allow students to be creative and create things they are interested in.  I will go over some of the major components of them and how they compare.  

## Coding Language:
BJC uses snap (block-based) the entire year while Code.org starts with a block based version of javascript and the later one introduces the option to shift into the text basded version.  I really like the block based languages they both use, especially the first few months of the course.  Both curriculum do an excellent job of introducing the functionality of new blocks.  But code.org has a huge advantage in that later on the same blocks that are used are transitioned into a text-based interface; you can toggle back and forth from blocks to text.  This allows students that need the support of the blocks that options but students that are ready to move on the opportunity.  It is also good to give them exposer to the text based coding for both the AP exam and future classes they may take. 

## Coding Projects
Both curriculum offer lots of opportunities for students to design and create coding projects.  The BJC projects tend to be more visually based (drawing things, moving things,...) while the code.org has visual components but more text focused.  The code.org offeres a bit more flexibility in they types of things students can create and allows a bit more student choice of topic.  \

## Non-coding aspects of the AP-CSP
Most of the non-coding parts of the AP-CSP standards are much better introduced int he code.org.  While BJC has a lot of great coding resources, it's coverage of other topics such as networks, data abstraction, cyrptography, cybersecrutiy... is not nearly as strong as code.org.  Code.org has a ton of great videos, interactive activities, and many other great resources to support these topics.  

## Organization/Ease of Grading
The BJC curriculum is well organized and for the most part easy to use for both teacher and students.  The day to day lessons on it are probably more clear to students that code.org; BJC is full of great instructions that include visualizations and tips.  On the other hand code.org is much easier on the teacher end to keep track of who has completed/missing assingments.  

## Overall
They are overall both good curriculum with lots of examples, projects and resources.  The code.org is just a bit more polished and easier to use as a teacher day-to-day.
