## Graphic Design

I would love to teach a one semester course on CS graphic design.  It would start with some general practices of good designing.  It could include topics such as:

- Typography
- Color
- Layout
- User Interface, User Experience
- Creating graphics (vector images)
- Editing photos
- Animations?

It would explore some concepts in coding (HTML/CSS and maybe a bit ofg javascript/p5) but the focus would be more on the creation of art using existing programs to facilitate.  
The course would come after the 1 semester intro to CS course my high school currently offers but would not require any thing more.  The focus would be on opening CS to students that are more into art than more rigourous/formal prorgamming.  The course would encourage them to be creative and express themselves without getting overwhelmed with coding.  It would also offer opportunites to showcase what they made.
