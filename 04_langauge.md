## Snap/Scratch vs Processing(p5)

### Overview
Snap and p5 (processings js version) are both excellent programs to use with students learning to program.  They both have the ability to quickly display graphics and animation in an engaging way. Snap is block based while P5 is text based.  

### Ease of Use, Syntax, running
Both programs are very easy to set up and run programs.  They both have free and reliable web applications to write and run the code with ease.

### Strengths of Snap/scratch
- Snap is much more intuitive for non-coders.  The nature of the clealy labled blocks the click into place make it very easy to pick up quickly.
- The shapes of the blocks also helps to distinguish between variables, functions, conditionals...  
- Very easy to upload images and sounds.
- The use of the sprite makes starting easier.  


### Strengths of p5
- P5 allows student to create beautiful graphics very quickly.  
- It is built as a an extension/library for javascript so there are ton of resources for it and students can continue using it for much more sophistcated CS topics.
- The text based language forces students to be more careful and pay attention to detail that can cause syntax errors.
- The error messages are usually pretty decent. 

### Weakness of Snap/scratch
- There are limited add-on libraries with snap.
- The program is very slow for doing complicated operations.
- Students can have issues when transitioning from the block based to text based language.  They don't develop the attention to detail required for complicated syntax.

### Weakness of p5
- There is very specific syntax needed for the text based language.  Often time a single missing curly brace or semi-colon can get students stuck for a long time.
- It is a bit more complicated than snap to upload images and sound files.
- Motion on the screen requires a few more skills in P5 in get working (without the defualt sprites like snap)


### What course is each best for?
- Snap is best for intro level courses.  It is easy to use and quick to get started with.  It can excite new students to coding and CS.
- p5 is better for students who have a lit bit of background coding, students that are already interested in coding and have chosen themselves to take the CS class.
