## Snap/Scratch vs Processing(p5)

### Overview
Snap and p5 (processings js version) are both excellent programs to use with students learning to program.  They both have the ability to quickly display graphics and animation in an engaging way. Snap is block based while P5 is text based.  

### Ease of Use, Syntax, running
Both programs are very easy to set up and run programs.  They both have free and reliable web applications to write and run the code with.  

### Strengths of Snap/scratch
Snap is much more intuitive for non-coders.  The nature of the clealy labled blocks the click into place make it very easy to pick up quickly.  The shapes of the blocks also helps to distinguish between variables, functions, conditionals...  


### Strengths of p5
P5 allows student to create beautiful graphics very quickly.  

### Weakness of Snap/scratch
