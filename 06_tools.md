## Code.org App Lab vs P5 Web Editor

## App Lab Code.org
https://studio.code.org/projects/applab

The app lab in code.org is an IDE for javascript with some extensive design features included.  It allows students to code both in blockbased or textbased version and convert back and forth between them (as long as their are no syntax errors preventing it returning to blockbased).  The IDE for coding itself is not the best but where it excels is how easily and effecively students can design their layout for an app designed to fit on something the size of a smart phone.  The can very quickly add images, buttons, sliders, text inputs, headings and change style elements like colors, font, and layout.

## P5 Web Editor
https://editor.p5js.org/

This is a quick and efficient way to code in javascript with p5.  The webeditor has it all set up and students can start drawing shapes on the canvas right away.  You can edit the HTML and CSS files but it is not necessary to get started.  

## Compare and contrast
Both of these tools are great and useful in both intro and more advanced CS class.  I use them with both my intro and AP-CSP classes. Overall I think the code.org app lab is better getting a working app that looks a bit more polished and refined.  The p5 web editor might have more options on the higher end but is less user friendly at the start.
