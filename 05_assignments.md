### Unit: Intro to Data Science

## 1) Filtering A List
### Overview
- The goal of this lesson activity is for students to take a list of items (eventually a table of date) and filter the list for a given criteria.  After a few examples with a single list, students are then going to filter a table (parallel arrays) for a given condition.  
### Activity
- Students are given a skeleton for some coding challenges with several lists and tables(parallel arrays) and comments clarify what each challenge is.
- The first example of a single list is done with the entire class together.  Ex. Filter this list of numbers and return an array of just the values that are between 100 and 500.
- Students then work in driver/navigator pairs to complete the rest of the challenges set up in the single list section. (all words with exactly 5 letters, all numbers that are not whole integers, words that start with the letter Q,...)
- Students are then shown an example of how to filter with parallel arrays (p5.Table) for more complicated conditions.  Ex. Return the names of all movies that have lifetime boxoffice gross over $1,000,000,000
- 
### Student facing instructions
- Open the starter code,
- Code-along examples for single array.
- Pair work (driver/navigator) each list filtering challenge in the starter code.
- Code-along example with parallel arrays (Table)
-  Pair work (driver/navigator) each list filtering challenge in the starter code.


## 2) Presenting Data in a Circle Graph
### Overview
- The goals is to eventually get students to create a program in p5 that will take in an array of numbers and display the data in a circle graph (pie chart).

### Activity
- Students are shown how the function arc() works in p5, as well as brief discussion on how to find percentages from a list of numbers and then how to convert those percents into angles for the a circle graph.  The first example is done complete with pencil/paper/calculator to make sure students are comfortable with the actual comutation part of it.
- Students are then challenged to take the activity they just did on paper and transfer it to p5, eventually creating code that can take any list of numbers and display it as a circle graph.
- The worksheet is laid out very step-by-step.
- The starter code has some basic outline but they are mostly left to figure it out with their partner using the previous example as a guide.
### Student facing instructions
- Complete with the class the workeheet on how to create a circel graph.  Using the data set (10,42,78,120). (The worksheet has the steps broken down on it, 1) find the total, 2) find the percent of each item out of the total 3)set up a ratio to find the central angle 4)sketch the graph
- Watch the demonstation of how the arc() function works and look over the p5 documentation.
- Create p5 code to do the exact same thing.
- Edit your code so that it could take any list of numbers and display it as a circle graph.
