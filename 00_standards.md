The two standards that I will show an example of a task/assignent for are:
- 9-12.IC.4 Assess personal and societal trade-offs related to computing technologies and data privacy. 
- 9-12.CT.1 Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.

The first one (IC.4) stresses trade-offs related to data privacy.  An activity for this would be a breif debate on the effects of internet "cookies".  After a brief whole class discussion on the basics of what cookies are and how they work, the students would be divided into small groups.  Some groups would be assignment to look up the benefits of cookies, what are they useful for.  Other groups would look up the potential harmful effects of cookies, how are they used to harm people?  A possible differentiation could be do give some of the groups specific articles or videos to get them started as well as an organziational sheet to help them structure the information they find.  After some research the groups would each breifly present what they learned.  After the mini-debate students are asked to create their own statement about what their opinion on cookies effects are.

The second lesson (CT.4) is about using models and simulations to predict outcomes.  For the standard the activity would be a coding activity that simulates dice rolls.  The first part of the task would be to create a function that simulates the roll of a standard dice.  They would then use their "dice" to simulate different probability problems that would be somewhat challenging mathemarically.  The examples could include things like "If you roll 3 dice, what is the probability that the sum is over 10", or "what is the probabilty if you roll 5 dice that none of them roll the same number".  This will give them practice using conditions and functions and show them how simulation can be used for complicated problems.  There would also be a discussion about how many simulations do you need to run to be sure you are correct?
